      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Merman started in a house in downtown Raleigh, NC when we started making cold brew to save money. After perfecting the recipe over several months, we began sharing it with our friends. When none of them could return to traditional coffee, we knew
        we needed to share our recipe with the world. It’s become our mission not only to create the perfect cup of coffee, but to create the perfect coffee experience by delivering it right to your home or office at the lowest possible price.</p>

      <h2>Why Concentrate?</h2>
      <p>One 18 oz bottle of Merman Cold Brew Concentrate is equal to 3 – 5 cups of traditional coffee. We recommend mixing in water at a 1 to 1 ratio, but the convenience of concentrate allows customers to choose their own taste. By the way, the term cold
        brew only refers to the brewing process, so try adding hot water for a hot cup of coffee and enjoy that classic merman flavor!</p>

        <h2>Our Brew</h2>
        <p>We only use the finest locally roasted beans. Our coffee is all Fair Trade and certified organic to provide you with the absolute best coffee drinking experience. Our concentrate is steeped for 20 hours and double filtered resulting in a smooth
          coffee taste without the acidity or bitterness of traditional coffee.</p>

        <h2>Low Waste</h2>
        <p>Merman operates sustainably by composting its beans and offering a bottle rebate program to our customers, resulting in a substantial discount for each returned bottle. This allows us to function at near zero waste.</p>
